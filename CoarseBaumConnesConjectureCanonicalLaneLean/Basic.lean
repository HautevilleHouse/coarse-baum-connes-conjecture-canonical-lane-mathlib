# coarse-baum-connes-conjecture-canonical-lane Lean migration boundary

This module records the source repository boundary and canonical-lane data
structures for the Lean migration. The source package translation lives in
`CoarseBaumConnesConjectureCanonicalLaneLean/SourcePackage.lean`.

This module records the source boundary and carries unrestricted source theorem
closure as an explicit remainder.
